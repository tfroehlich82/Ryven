# Philosophy :cyclone:

Ryven is meant to be a **simple** and **transparent** tool for visual scripting in Python.
It does not intend to replace textual source code in general by the diagram representation, rather to enhance it.
The idea is to provide a simple but powerful system for nodes and node packages with virtually no restrictions, so even fairly advanced mechanisms can be built on top of it.

# Contributions In General :rocket:

There are many ways you can contribute to the Ryven project. Particularly effective options include improvement of

- docstrings
- online documentation
- example content: nodes and projects
- modularity improvements

# Creating Good Issues :mega:

- you might want to check
  - the [information on the website](https://ryven.org/)
  - the [wiki](https://github.com/leon-thomm/Ryven/wiki)
  - the [ryvencore documentation](https://leon-thomm.github.io/ryvencore/)
- be precise and **include a minimal procedure to reproduce the problem**
- notice there's also a [discussions section](https://github.com/leon-thomm/ryven/discussions), but you can also use the issue tracker for questions

Thanks for hanging around and have a nice day!
