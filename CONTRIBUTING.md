# Philosophy :cyclone:

Ryven is meant to be a **simple** and **transparent** tool for visual scripting in Python.
It does not intend to replace textual source code by the diagram representation, rather to enhance it.
Any form of optimization shall only be considered if it does not seriously restrict or significantly complicate
the functionality of the software.

# Contributions In General :rocket:

There are many different ways you can contribute to the Ryven project.
If you want to help out, there are a few very effective options including

- consequent and precise docstrings
- better online documentation
- content: nodes and examples

# Creating Good Issues :mega:

- you might check the [information on the website](https://ryven.org/guides) before you open a new issue
- if it's an issue about the software, make sure to always include a precise desctiption of the problem and reproduction steps
- you can also use the discussions area for suggestions around possible improvements and FAQ

Have a great day!
